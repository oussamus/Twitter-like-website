# Twitter-like-website
This project is for SOEN 341 class which is given at Concordia University. The goal is to create a twitter like website with 3 core features: Posting Tweets, "Like" a tweet, and Follow a user. Additionally, one extra core feature needs to be implemented which will be decided by the team members and approved by our client which in this case is our TA.
